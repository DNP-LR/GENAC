kew: a lightweight (and super fast) promise/deferred framework for node.js
==================================

**kew** is a lightweight promise framework with an aim of providing a base set of functionality similar to that provided by the [Q library](https://github.com/kriskowal/q "Q").

A few answers (for a few questions)
-------

*Why'd we write it?*

During our initial usage of **Q** we found that it was consuming 80% of the cpu under load (primarily in chained database callbacks). We spent some time looking at patching **Q** and ultimately found that creating our own lightweight library for server-usage would suit our needs better than figuring out how to make a large cross-platform library more performant on one very specific platform.

*So this does everything Q does?*

Nope! **Q** is still an awesome library and does *way* more than **kew**. We support a tiny subset of the **Q** functionality (the subset that we happen to use in our actual use cases).

What are Promises?
-------

At its core, a *Promise* is a promise to return a value at some point in the future. A *Promise* represents a value that will be (or may return an error if something goes wrong). *Promises* heavily reduce the complexity of asynchronous coding in node.js-like environments. Example:

```javascript
// assuming the getUrlContent() function exists and retrieves the content of a url
var htmlPromise = getUrlContent(myUrl)

// we can then filter that through an http parser (our imaginary parseHtml() function) asynchronously (or maybe synchronously, who knows)
var tagsPromise = htmlPromise.then(parseHtml)

// and then filter it through another function (getLinks()) which retrieves only the link tags
var linksPromise = tagsPromise.then(getLinks)

// and then parses the actual urls from the links (using parseUrlsFromLinks())
var urlsPromise = linksPromise.then(parseUrlsFromLinks)

// finally, we have a promise that should only provide us with the urls and will run once all the previous steps have ran
urlsPromise.then(function (urls) {
  // do something with the urls
})
```

How do I use **kew**?
-------

As a precursor to all the examples, the following code must be at the top of your page:

```javascript
var Q = require('kew')
```

### Convert a literal into a promise

The easiest way to start a promise chain is by creating a new promise with a specified literal using Q.resolve() or Q.reject()

```javascript
// create a promise which passes a value to the next then() call
var successPromise = Q.resolve(val)

// create a promise which throws an error to be caught by the next fail() call
var failPromise = Q.reject(err)
```

In addition, you can create deferreds which can be used if you need to create a promise but resolve it later:

```javascript
// create the deferreds
var successDefer = Q.defer()
var failDefer = Q.defer()

// resolve or reject the defers in 1 second
setTimeout(function () {
  successDefer.resolve("ok")
  failDefer.reject(new Error("this failed"))
}, 1000)

// extract promises from the deferreds
var successPromise = successDefer.promise
var failPromise = failDefer.promise
```

If you have a node-style callback (taking an **Error** as the first parameter and a response as the second), you can call the magic `makeNodeResolver()` function on a defer to allow the defer to handle the callbacks:

```javascript
// create the deferred
var defer = Q.defer()

// some node-style function
getObjectFromDatabase(myObjectId, defer.makeNodeResolver())

// grab the output
defer.promise
  .then(function (obj) {
    // successfully retrieved the object
  })
  .fail(function (e) {
    // failed retrieving the object
  })
```
